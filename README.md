# crypter
Simple python program to encrypt:closed_lock_with_key: & decrypt:unlock: confidential and important files inside a folder recursively :)
<br/>
Using `128 bit AES` encryption with python's `Crypto` module:snake:

#### Encrypt files:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run the program as `python crypter.py`

* Press `E` for encryption
* Enter any secret encryption key (and keep it secret:wink:)
* press `y` to delete original files after encryption
  <br/>or press `n` to be on safer side and delete the files afterwards manually
* Choose the folder to start encryption (Choose the folder correctly or you might accidentally delete wrong files:hushed:)
* and your files are safe from the prying eyes:sunglasses:

#### Decrypt files:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run the program as `python crypter.py`

* Press `D` for encryption
* Enter the secret decryption key (you remember it, right? :open_mouth:)
* press `y` to delete encrypted files after decryption
  <br/>or press `n` to be on safer side and delete the files afterwards manually
* Choose the folder to start decryption
* and your files are back from the safe heaven:sunglasses:
